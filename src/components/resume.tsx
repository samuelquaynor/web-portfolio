            <p>
              During my time at university, I learned a variety of programming
              languages such as Java, Python, and C++. I also gained experience
              in software development methodologies and learned about data
              structures, algorithms, and database management. I was able to
              apply this knowledge in various projects, including developing a
              mobile app for a local business and a website for a non-profit
              organization. In addition, I participated in coding competitions
              and hackathons to further enhance my skills and knowledge.
              Overall, my education has provided me with a strong foundation in
              computer science and has prepared me for a successful career in
              software development.
